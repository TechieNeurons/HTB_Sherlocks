# Lockpick2.0

## Speech
```
We've been hit by Ransomware again, but this time the threat actor seems to have upped their skillset. Once again a they've managed to encrypt a large set of our files. It is our policy NOT to negotiate with criminals. Please recover the files they have encrypted - we have no other option! Unfortunately our CEO is on a no-tech retreat so can't be reached. Warning This is a warning that this Sherlock includes software that is going to interact with your computer and files. This software has been intentionally included for educational purposes and is NOT intended to be executed or used otherwise. Always handle such files in isolated, controlled, and secure environments. Once the Sherlock zip has been unzipped, you will find a DANGER.txt file. Please read this to proceed.
